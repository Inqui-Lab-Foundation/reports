<h3>Refund/Cancellation Policy </h3>

<h4>Technical issue</h4>
<p>In case of any technical issue due to which the payment gets deducted from the payerâ€™s account and does not show in
    our official NGI Payments Portal but the payment gateway service clearly mentions the confirmed settlement there
    after the NGI account receives the payment. We manually submit the payment in our NGI Accounts. It should take 7-10
    working days for the payment to be credited in account.
<p>
<h4>Multiple Payments Case:</h4>
<p>If double payment happens and the payment gateway service clearly mentions it, the NGI will refund the payment after
    the NGI account receives payment. Which should take 7-10 working days for the back payment or we can adjust the
    amount to the next Semester fee as per Payers request.</p>
<h4>Other Payments Case:</h4>
<p>In all other cases where there is a discrepancy in the fee paid, the parent/students has to directly contact the NGI
    Accoutns Teamd and the NGI Accounts Team decision would be final.</p>

<p>Transaction fee charges would not be refunded/ reversed under any circumstances for any refund/ reversal /chargeback
    and any other reasons. </p>
<p> Fees once paid which are non-refundable for any reason or any other cancellation clause of NGI. </p>
